## Article
- Will A.I. Kill Translation Jobs?
    - AI is transforming translation, with Harlequin France testing Fluent Planet's AI-assisted tools to make processes cheaper and faster for popular English-French novels. This shift sparks outrage from translator groups, who deem cutting human ties unacceptable, while other publishers seek similar AI quotes amid rising demand. Research shows translation as highly vulnerable to generative AI, potentially displacing jobs like typists. EU linguist employment rose slightly per latest data.
